## Objective
To clean and preprocess a raw sales dataset using Python for further analysis.

## Tools Used
- Python
- Pandas
- Jupyter Notebook

## Files in this Repository
- `train.csv` – Original dataset

## Task 2: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
In this task, I performed an exploratory analysis of the cleaned sales data to uncover key trends and patterns.

### Key Visualizations:
- **Top 10 States by Orders**: Identified California as the leading market.
